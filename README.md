# VSim

#The project I made for my A-Level Computer Science NEA. It is a 'virus simulator' - using parameters you give the program it simulates how a virus might spread from a selected location. It includes a graph that plots numerical data related to the simulation and a control panel to change the speed of the simulation and access the settings menu. Many more interesting projects to come!
